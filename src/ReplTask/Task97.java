  /*1. Complete the Dog.java class
     Include the following class variables:
    * name=Tarzan 
    * breed=Mutt 
    * weight= 50.0
    All class variables should be declared lowercase, also make mutt static
    Write two constructors:
    * The main constructor(with all parameters)
    * A secondary constructor that takes in only Name and Weight (Breed defaults to "Mutt")
    2.Test your code with the Main.java class:
     Create a Dog object using both Constructors and print their fields/states to make sure it's correct.
     Output:
     1.The main constructor(with all parameters)=Tarzan Mutt 50.0
     2.secondary constructor that takes in only Name and Weight (Breed defaults to "Mutt")
     =Tarzan Mutt 50.0
